# Turing-Seminar-Project-MVA-2023
On this project we mainly focus ourselves on the following question : Is it possible that defense never wins ? in the context of ML models. Thanks to several articles, websites we define important key notions concerning ML models attacks as Trojans attacks/backdoors, adversarial attacks and so on by given some instances and by explaining briefly some non trivial mechanisms.
The report was done mostly in french.
